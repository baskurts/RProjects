# reformat the cylinder data in mtcars so that
# instead of it being in a data frame, it will be
# in a table
# 1. barplot works better with tables than data frames
# 2. the created table will be stored in an object

# get R help on the table function
?table

# the left arrow operator is the equivalent
# of the assignment operator

# give barplot function cylinder object
# the x-axis told us the different types of cylinders
# the y-axis told us the number of data points in
# each cylinder
